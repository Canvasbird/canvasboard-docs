## What is Canvasboard
**Canvasboard** is an interactive board with plugins focusing on replacing the need of multiple platforms for teaching, presenting or explaining your ideas. The interactive plugins are built using web technologies to ease your work right within a single platform.
## Why it is important?
**Problems**

Performing a certain task requires a person to move through quite a few interfaces/tabs to get the right plugins. This makes it time consuming and with the vast variety available nowadays, there is a lot of confusion as to when and where each plugin should be rendered from?

**Educational Sector:üìö**

Online teaching has become the new norm for most of the institutes, schools, and colleges amidst the pandemic. There are many limitations for online teaching for institutes such as  flexibility, cost, connectivity and others. Teachers are using various online platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft teams to interact with the students and help them learn new concepts. But the most important effective and learning way for a student is the conventional blackboard learning which has been traditionally followed. Due to the online ways of teaching, teachers are only able to share powerpoint presentations which is not very effective for the students. 

What if a student has missed the class and wants to refer to those notes before examinations. There is no way of doing this. Also, sharing notes has become increasingly difficult. People take photos on their phones instead of saving it directly on their desktops/laptops.

**Solution**

CanvasBoard helps solve all the problems mentioned above. It makes e-teaching and learning easier for the teacher and students. It is a board that helps the teachers share presentations, write and type at the same time. It‚Äôs a one-stop platform that enhances online teaching by making it interactive. One of the key features is that everything gets persisted and can be referred to later. This includes everything the teachers have written during the presentation. This is helpful for the students for their future reference. If they‚Äôve missed a class or have to refer to notes before exams, all they have to do is login and retrieve notes required.

People using CanvasBoard also have a personalised notes taking extension that pops us like a chat window right beside the document they are referring to. They can jot down the points they find important there and they can also save images from the documents in the chat window. Sharing them is pretty easy as a unique link will be generated for the images thus enabling them to pass it on to their colleagues and friends.

**Data Scienceüìà**

Data Science is a booming field in technology. Data scientists write tons of algorithms to make our lives easier. What is the first step they do when they get a dataset? Data exploration. For this first step itself they have to write many lines of code. A dataset contains loads of data. They have to find the duplicates, produce graphs amongst other data exploration techniques.

**Solutionüí°**

Data Science has made our lives easier but what if there is something that makes their work easier thus helping them more productive!
CanvasBoard has a great plugin that will help in automating data exploration. It saves the time of the data scientists from writing the unnecessary 100 lines of codes. It helps in generating all the graphs required in the beginning stage and helps get an outcome of the scattered dataset given to them. 

_Technology has helped come up with a board that is a dedicated workspace for all your needs._ 
Canvasboard can be scaled up to onboard multiple plugins in one place that can be used for the various business needs. The education sector, data scientists, and project managers will surely find their work become easier with the help of this platform. Rather than installing multiple different softwares, a person can have one single board to satiate all the requirements for their jobs. From writing on presentations, data exploration, and producing gantt charts, this board will definitely fulfill all needs.


**Goal ‚úîÔ∏è**

To build a standalone web application and chrome extension that improves and enhances user experience.
